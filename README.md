## **Problem Description**

The Workout Overview, one of the most frequently used areas of the Nuli app, has remained untouched for a long time. Given that our app underwent a significant design evolution more than a year ago, the current aesthetic of the workout summary has become noticeably outdated, creating a visual disconnect within the app.

The goal is not only to modernize the look and feel of this important view, but also to reinforce a cohesive brand identity throughout the app, while ensuring that all existing functionality within this screen remains intact and unaffected.

## **Objective**

Demonstrate your front-end skills by integrating a full app view, focusing on clean code and user delight - through animations, micro-interactions, and a smooth experience particularly on iOS devices.

## **Steps**

1. **Analyze the Mockup**: [ðŸ”—Â Here is](https://www.figma.com/design/YE1ZM3FvRBYt0XtYKuCH22/Nuli-%7C-Workout-Overview?node-id=0%3A1&t=dj2mFW0yDnKBkDYu-1) the Figma mockup of the new Workout Overview screen.

2. **Implement the Interface**: Create a user-friendly interface for the updated Workout Overview screen. This includes:
   - Implementing the view as per the Figma mockup.
       <aside>
       ðŸ’¡ ***Note**: We don't necessarily expect you to be able to implement the full view in the time allotted. Feel free to choose what makes the most sense for you - and be sure to explain your choices in the presentation video.*
       
       </aside>

   - Implementing relevant animations and micro-interactions using animation libraries.
       <aside>
       ðŸ’¡ ***Note**: You have the freedom to choose which animations to implement and for which elements, as long as it supports the goal of ensuring a smooth, delightful user experience.*

3. **Test on iOS**: Ensure the application works seamlessly on an iOS simulator or a real iPhone, focusing on the quality of user interactions and overall experience.

   <aside>
   ðŸ’¡ ***Note**: This focus is due to the fact that more than 90% of our user base is made up of iOS users.*

## **Deliverables**

- A **React Native Project**: Complete the implementation of the updated Workout Overview screen as per the provided Figma mockup, including UI components and animations.
- A **Video Demonstration and Presentation**: Record a short video demonstrating the functionality and animations of the implemented feature on an iOS simulator or a real iPhone.
- **Code Documentation**: When relevant, provide comments and documentation within the code to explain the logic and usage of libraries and tools.

## **Evaluation Criteria**

- **Code Quality**: Clean, well-documented, and maintainable code.
- **Functionality**: Correct implementation of the required features from the mockup.
- **User Experience**: Smooth and visually appealing interface, quality of the animations and micro-interactions.
- **Attention to Detail**: Precision in replicating the Figma mockup, including design elements and interactions.
- **Technical Proficiency**: Effective use of React Native, TypeScript, and animation libraries.
- **Problem-Solving Skills**: Ability to handle real-world challenges and provide robust solutions.
